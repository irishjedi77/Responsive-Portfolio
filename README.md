# Responsive-Portfolio

The goal of this project was to create a basic responsive portfolio using HTML, CSS, and media queries. The site includes an About, Portfolio, and Contact page. This portfolio uses three `@media screen` tags, including `max-width`s: `980px`, `768px` and `640px`. This ensures that the site is viewable on a phone or tablet in landscape or standard view. 

The default position of the header is static when the screen is`640px` wide and includes a viewport tag so that the site functions properly on mobile devices.
